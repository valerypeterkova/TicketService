                    <p>1.Scope of validity
                        <br/>The Terms and Conditions apply to legal relations between patrons, on the one hand, and
                        the Berlin City Hall Foundation, on the other, concerning the latter's artistic
                        establishments
                        (Deutsche Oper Berlin, Staatsoper Unter den Linden, Komishe Oper Berlin and
                        Staatsballett Berlin). Where the following refers explicitly only to the Berlin City Hall
                        Foundation, this also refers implicitly to ist artistic establishments.
                        <br/> The Terms and Conditions form part of the contract which comes into existence when
                        tickets are purchased.
                        <br/>The Terms and Conditions also apply to subscribers and patron organisations and
                        their
                        members, if not waived by a separate agreement.</p>

                    <p>2. Schedules ans start times
                        <br/>The valid schedules and start times can be found in the official publications of the Berlin
                        City Hall Foundation.
                        <br/>The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to alter the schedules and casts.
                        <br/>The Berlin City Hall Foundation accepts no responsibility for information on posters
                        or other
                        publications.</p>

                    <p>3.Entrance fee
                        <br/>The Berlin City Hall Foundation will publish the valid entrance fees and make them known
                        at the ticket offices. Discounts are available to groups of persons with special
                        entitlements,
                        upon presentation of an appropriate certificate at the ticket office. Discounted tickets are
                        valid only with this certificate. If the certificate cannot be produced, the difference
                        between
                        the discount fee and the full entrance fee must be paid in full.</p>

                    <p>4. Provision of tickets
                        <br/>Tickets will be sold in advance for a season at the times listed in the publications of the
                        Berlin City Hall Foundation. The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to limit the
                        number of tickets per buyer in individual cases. Severely disabled people can be given
                        preferential treatment.
                        <br/>Ticket orders in writing will be processed from the start od the advance sale period on
                        a
                        'first come, first served' basis. There is, however, no right to have orders processed
                        on this
                        basis. Telephone ticket orders will be accepted from the start of the advance sale
                        period.
                        If payment for ordered tickets is not received within the stipulated time limit, these
                        tickets
                        will be made available for resale. Pre-paid tickets can be sent by post on request. Both
                        the
                        costs and the risks of sending them by post will be borne by the purchaser.
                        <br/>Purchased entry tickets may not be resold for commercial purposes within the prior
                        consent of the Berlin City Hall Foundation. If contravened, the Berlin City Hall
                        Foundation
                        reserves the right to legal recourse. Furthermore, the Foundation is entitled to
                        refuse to sell
                        entry tickets in future to those contravening the aforementioned prohibition.
                        <br/>The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to alter or amend existing
                        ticket sale
                        regulations. They will be published and made known at the ticket offices by the
                        Berlin City
                        Hall Foundation.</p>
                    <p>5. Ticket refunds
                        <br/>Sold tickets will not be refunded, nor will compensation be paid for expired tickets,
                        except
                        in the cases listed below.
                        <br/>The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to alter casts, and cast alterations
                        do not
                        entitle ticket holders to have their tickets refunded.
                        <br/>If the work performed is different from that indicated when the ticket was
                        purchased, the
                        ticket can be returned before the beginning of the performance and the ticket price
                        will be
                        refunded.
                        <br/>If a performance is cancelled without substitution, the ticket price will be
                        refunded, as long
                        as the tickets are presented or sent to Patron Services within 30 days of the
                        scheduled date
                        of the performance.
                        <br/>If a performance is ended prematurely, patrons are entitled to have their
                        tickets refunded
                        only if the performance is ended before the first interval, or, if the
                        performance does not
                        have an interval, if it is ended before half of its scheduled duration has
                        elapsed. Even in
                        these cases, claims for refunds are valid only if the tickets are presented
                        or sent to Patron
                        Services within 30 days of the date of the performance.
                        <br/>Apart from the right to have the entrance fee refunded, as provided in
                        the above
                        paragraphs, no other expenses or damages claimed by patrons will be
                        paid.</p>
                    <p>6. Lost tickets
                        <br/>If a patron loses his ticket, he or she will be provided with a replacement ticket at the
                        ticket office, as long as he or she gives a believable account of which ticket he or she has
                        purchased. The holder of an original ticket takes precedence over the holder of a
                        replacement ticket.</p>
                    <p>7. Entry
                        <br/>The audience cloakrooms and foyers are ordinarily opened one hour before the beginning
                        of a performance.
                        <br/>No one is entitled to enter after the performance has begun. If a patron is denied entry
                        on
                        account of his or her lateness, he or she has no right to have his or her ticket
                        refunded.</p>
                    <p>8. Cloakroom
                        <br/>Objects and clothing carried by the guest, in particular backpacks, suitcases or larger
                        bags
                        have to be deposited at the cloakroom during the performance. Animals will categorically
                        not be supervised. The Berlin City Hall Foundation reserves the right to charge a cloakroom
                        fee.
                        <br/>Coats left for supervision are insured in accordance with published insurance terms and
                        conditions. Patrons of Deutsche Oper Berlin can leave furs for supervision only in
                        designated cloakrooms for an insurance fee.
                        <br/>Supervised property will be returned upon presentation of cloakroom tags without
                        further
                        proof of ownership. If no tag is presented, cloakroom items left for supervision
                        will be
                        returned only if the patron gives a believable account of his or her entitlement to
                        the items.
                        If the patron receives the wrong items, his or her items are damaged, or he or she
                        has lost
                        the cloakroom tag, this must be reported immediately to the cloakroom personnel. If
                        a tag
                        is lost, the patron is liable for replacement costs.</p>
                    <p>9. Lost property
                        <br/>Lost property of any description found in the performance venues of the Berlin City Hall
                        Foundation must be handed in to the house or cloakroom personnel. Lost property will be
                        dealt with in accordance with the provisions of §§ 978ff. of the German Civil Code.</p>
                    <p>10. Householders’ rights
                        <br/>Householders’ rights are attributed to the Directors, who entrust their employees, in
                        particular, their evening personnel, to exercise these rights. The instructions of the
                        personnel at the performance venues must be followed.
                        <br/>Patrons can be refused entry to the performance venues if there is reason to believe
                        that
                        they will disrupt the performance or upset other patrons. Patrons can be sent out of
                        performances in progress if they are disrupting these performances or upsetting other
                        patrons, or if they do not have valid tickets for their seats. Entry can also be refused
                        to
                        patrons who have repeatedly breached these General Terms and Conditions. These patrons
                        have no right to have their entrance fees refunded, or to compensation for any damages
                        or
                        expenses of any other description.
                        <br/>Persons preventing the sale of tickets or upsetting patrons can be sent out of the
                        performance venues. It is not permitted to offer tickets for sale in the ticket
                        office halls or
                        anywhere else in the performance venues or their premises.
                        <br/>It is not permitted to take seats other than those indicated on the tickets. If
                        a patron
                        changes seats without entitlement, the Berlin City Hall Foundation can charge
                        the patron
                        the difference between the paid ticket price and the ticket price for the seat
                        occupied, send
                        him or her back to the seat marked on the ticket, or send him or her out of the
                        performance.
                        Mobile phones, watches and any other technical devices with acoustic signals
                        must be
                        switched off for the duration of the performance.
                        <br/>Smoking in the performance venues of the Berlin City Hall Foundation is
                        permitted only in
                        designated areas.</p>
                    <p>11. Image and sound recording
                        <br/>Patrons are forbidden to make image and/or sound recordings of any kind. Patrons can be
                        sent out of the performance venues for violations of this rule.
                        <br/>If image and sound recordings during a performance are carried out by persons authorised
                        by the Berlin City Hall Foundation, the patrons agree, by their presence at the
                        performance,
                        that their images and words may be recorded, and that they have no right to remuneration
                        if
                        these are broadcast or published.</p>
                    <p>12. Liability
                        <br/>The Berlin City Hall Foundation, its representatives and its employees accept no liability
                        for
                        damages of any kind suffered by patrons of its performance venues, except for those
                        caused by malice or gross negligence. Liability for injury to life, limb and health remains
                        unaffected, if the damages in question could ordinarily have been expected.</p>
                    <p>13. Data privacy
                        <br/>The personal order data can be collected, processed and used for the purpose of customer
                        care by the Berlin City Hall Foundation (Deutsche Oper Berlin, Staatsoper Unter den
                        Linden, Komische Oper Berlin und Staatsballett Berlin) if the visitor has given his consent
                        during the purchase process. Customer care is defined as taking measures intended to
                        supply the customer with significant information and thus further provide the customer with
                        specific benefits. The customer was informed that he can at any time revoke this agreement
                        without prejudice. Berlin City Hall Foundation affirmed that data privacy is absolutely
                        ensured and that the data will not be transmitted to third parties.</p>
                    <p>14. Term of validity
                        <br/>These General Terms and Conditions will come into force on 1st September 2017. At the
                        same time, the General Terms and Conditions of the Berlin City Hall Foundation valid up to
                        that point will expire.</p>
                    <p>15. Concluding clause
                        <br/>Should any stipulation of these General Terms and Conditions be invalid, the legal validity
                        of
                        the remaining Terms and Conditions will remain unaffected. The Berlin City Hall Foundation
                        is neither prepared nor obliged to take part in dispute settlement procedures by any
                        consumer dispute settlement authority.
                        <br/>This English translation of the General Terms & Conditions is a service of the Berlin
                        City Hall
                        Foundation. Thus the current German version is solely legally binding.</p>
