    the Berlin City Hall Foundation, on the other, concerning the latter's artistic establishments
    (Deutsche Oper Berlin, Staatsoper Unter den Linden, Komishe Oper Berlin and
    Staatsballett Berlin). Where the following refers explicitly only to the Berlin City Hall
    Foundation, this also refers implicitly to ist artistic establishments.
    <br> The Terms and Conditions form part of the contract which comes into existence when
    tickets are purchased.
    <br>The Terms and Conditions also apply to subscribers and patron organisations and their
    members, if not waived by a separate agreement.</p>

    at the ticket offices. Discounts are available to groups of persons with special entitlements,

    valid only with this certificate. If the certificate cannot be produced, the difference between

    will be made available for resale. Pre-paid tickets can be sent by post on request. Both the
    costs and the risks of sending them by post will be borne by the purchaser.
    <br>Purchased entry tickets may not be resold for commercial purposes within the prior
